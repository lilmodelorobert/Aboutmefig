Figma Your Life
Figma about my life

Peer review comments: I really like the use of the shyguy with a sombrero as your home button on your nav bar! This is definitely not complete, but I see what you were going for as I'm looking at your Figma. You could have centered your containers better using justify-content to make it match your Figma a little bit better. I like the black and white color scheme you're going with. The social media icons aren't quite aligned right either, but they link to the right websites. Your interests and accomplishments pages aren't finished, but they're linked up and I can navigate between them. The site is incomplete, but this is a decent effort.
